# RAG-Enhanced Chat Architecture Design

## Overview
This document outlines the new architecture for the MealPrep Agent that integrates Recipe Extraction, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and optimized chat functionality.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Recipe Extraction Pipeline
```
User Input → n8n AI Agent → Recipe Parser → Database Storage → Vector Embedding
```

### 2. RAG System
```
User Query → Vector Search → Recipe Retrieval → Context Injection → AI Response
```

### 3. Optimized Chat Flow
```
User Message → Intent Detection → Route to RAG or General Chat → Response
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Enhancement
- Add vector embeddings to recipes table
- Create recipe search indexes
- Add recipe metadata for better retrieval

### Phase 2: Recipe Extraction System
- Enhanced n8n workflow for recipe parsing
- Structured recipe storage
- Automatic embedding generation

### Phase 3: RAG Implementation
- Vector similarity search
- Context-aware recipe retrieval
- Intelligent query routing

### Phase 4: Chat Optimization
- Intent-based routing
- Faster response times
- Recipe-aware conversations

## Benefits
- **Speed**: Faster responses through intent routing
- **Accuracy**: Recipe-specific knowledge from database
- **Scalability**: Vector search handles large recipe collections
- **Intelligence**: Context-aware responses about user's recipes
