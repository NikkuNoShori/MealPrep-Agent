## ADR-004: Frontend State Management - Zustand

### Status: Implemented ‚úÖ

### Context
The PRD specified Zustand for state management, which was implemented successfully.

### Decision
Zustand was chosen over Redux for:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal boilerplate code
- **TypeScript Support**: Excellent TypeScript integration
- **Bundle Size**: Smaller bundle size compared to Redux
- **Learning Curve**: Easier for small team to adopt

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Clean, maintainable state management
- ‚úÖ Excellent TypeScript support
- ‚úÖ Minimal boilerplate code
- ‚úÖ Good performance characteristics

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Smaller ecosystem compared to Redux
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fewer middleware options
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Less community resources for complex patterns

## ADR-005: Chat Interface - HTTP Polling over WebSocket

### Status: Implemented ‚úÖ

### Context
The PRD specified WebSocket support for real-time chat, but the implementation uses HTTP polling.

### Decision
Implemented HTTP polling for chat because:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and debug
- **Serverless Compatibility**: Works well with Vercel Edge Functions
- **Reliability**: More reliable than WebSocket connections
- **Development Speed**: Faster to implement for MVP

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Working chat interface with Chef Marcus AI
- ‚úÖ Compatible with serverless architecture
- ‚úÖ Easier debugging and error handling
- ‚úÖ Faster development cycle

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Higher latency compared to WebSocket
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More server requests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need WebSocket migration for better UX

## ADR-006: Authentication - JWT over Firebase Auth

### Status: Implemented ‚úÖ

### Context
The PRD specified Firebase Auth, but the implementation uses JWT-based authentication.

### Decision
Chose JWT authentication because:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and understand
- **Database Integration**: Works well with NeonDB
- **Flexibility**: Custom user management and family accounts
- **Cost**: No additional Firebase costs

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Simple, working authentication system
- ‚úÖ Custom family account management
- ‚úÖ No additional service dependencies
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective solution

**Trade-offs:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual security implementation

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to implement password reset, email verification

## ADR-007: File Storage - Local Storage over Cloud Storage

### Status: Implemented ‚úÖ

### Context
The PRD specified Cloud Storage for images and files, but the implementation uses local storage.

### Decision
Chose local storage because:
- **Development Speed**: Faster to implement for MVP
- **Cost**: No additional storage costs during development
- **Simplicity**: Easier to debug and test
- **Future Migration**: Can migrate to cloud storage later

### Consequences
**Positive:**
- ‚úÖ Faster development cycle
- ‚úÖ No additional costs during development
